# AutoHotKey-Shortcuts
My personal keyboard shortcuts that are made with AutoHotKey

This is a utility that helps you type faster while programming. Instead of having to move your right hand all the way over to the arrow keys to move around, just to move them all the way back before you can start typing, now you barely have to move your fingers :)

## Shortcuts
- alt+j = Left arrow
- alt+k = Down arrow
- alt+l = Right arrow
- alt+i = Up arrow
- alt+u = Home
- alt+o = End
